.
.SH "NAME"
\fBschooner\-contrast\fR \- color correct a single raster image\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBschooner\-contrast\fR \fIin\fR\.tif \fIout\fR\.tif
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBschooner\-contrast\fR tool attempts to automatically color correct a landsat image\. It uses two algorithms, the first is CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) which attempts to color correct an image while improving the local contrast of the image\.
.
.P
The other is simple histogram stretching and clipping\. The tool calculates a histogram by band, and stretches the raster values to the range 0 to 255\. It also discards the top and bottom 0\.05% of values\.
.
.SH "CAVEATS"
Unlike \fBlandsat\-util\fR, \fBschooner\-contrast\fR does not perform gamma correction\. If you are working with landsat 8 images it is probably better to use \fBlandsat\-util\fR\'s builtin color correction\.
.
.P
If you are working with older landsat data, or data from sensors like MODIS, \fBschooner\-contrast\fR works acceptably well\.
